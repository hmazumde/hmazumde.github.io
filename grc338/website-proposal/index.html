            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Reformative Roasts Co.</p>
            
            <p>My company is a coffeeshop locally-based in the Seattle, Washington region. We specialize in sourcing the highest quality coffee beans and roasts all throughout the world and are passionate about exploring all the flavorful notes that can be found through a sip of coffee. Additionally, we work with a lot of our local bean farmers to produce freshly roasted coffee daily. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Our customer base is made up of the fabulous locals of the Seattle (Ballard neighborhood) area! Seattle is a big city consisting of several neighborhoods and surrounded by plenty of populated urban and suburban populations.  </p>
           
            <p>We hope to use this website to build outreach outside of Ballard, Seattle, and hope to continue reaching communities outside of the state. </p>

                    <h4> Hello Friends!</h4>
                
                <p> We specialize in ethically sourcing single origin coffee beans locally and all throughout the world. We are passionate about exploring all the flavorful notes that can be found through a sip of coffee. Additionally, we work to produce freshly roasted coffee daily.</p>

				<img src="womenInCoffee.png" alt="woman standing next to a coffee bean plant, smiling" />
				<p>Reformative Roasts Co. is a specialty coffee roaster and café based in Seattle. All our coffees come from sustainable women-owned farms and co-ops, and a percentage of every sale goes to supporting women's nonprofits around the world.</p>	
               
                <p> Coffee is a much-loved daily ritual around the world with global sales reaching into the billions. Yet women coffee producers have historically been overlooked and under compensated. Reports show that women often comprise up to 70 percent of the manual labor on coffee farms—planting, picking, processing, sorting—yet are far less represented in decision-making, trading, analysis, or business ownership.</p>
			     
                <p> This is why Reformative Roasts Co. works specifically with women producers to ensure they receive their fair share of the profits and that gender equality is respected at every stage of production. This empowerment leads to better outcomes for families and communities, and the beans consistently score higher in quality.</p>
