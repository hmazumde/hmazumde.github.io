                    Reformative Roasts Co. is a specialty coffee roaster and café based in Seattle. All our coffees come from sustainable women-owned farms and co-ops, and a percentage of every sale goes to supporting women's nonprofits
                    around the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coffee is a much-loved daily ritual around the world with global sales reaching into the billions. Yet women coffee producers have historically been overlooked and under compensated. Reports show that women often
                    comprise up to 70 percent of the manual labor on coffee farms—planting, picking, processing, sorting—yet are far less represented in decision-making, trading, analysis, or business ownership.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is why Reformative Roasts Co. works specifically with women producers to ensure they receive their fair share of the profits and that gender equality is respected at every stage of production. This empowerment leads
                    to better outcomes for families and communities, and the beans consistently score higher in quality.
